Iâ€™m Isaiah Lee, a software development student at Mohawk College. My journey into programming began as a hobby, driven by my passion for game development. As my skills developed, I experimented heavily with web development, both back-end and front-end. I also found myself loving object-oriented programming, with Java being my language of choice.

Computer Science is fascinating to me, and I love learning about different concepts, whether they are theoretical or more practical. Currently, I'm honing my skills in full-stack development, with a particular interest in working with databases. Whether I am creating an intuitive user interface, or the back-end of an application, I love the process of creating.
